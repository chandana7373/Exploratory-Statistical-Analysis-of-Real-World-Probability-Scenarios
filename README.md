# Applied Probability & Statistical Analysis Using R

## Project Overview
This project applies probability theory and statistical analysis techniques to real-world scenarios using R. The objective is to model uncertainty, analyze data distributions, and extract meaningful insights through statistical inference and visualization. The analysis emphasizes interpretation and decision-making rather than raw computation.

## Problem Context
The project explores multiple applied scenarios, including:
- Modeling win probabilities in professional sports
- Evaluating product life-span reliability in manufacturing
- Assessing data normality and sampling behavior
- Understanding relationships between quantitative variables

These scenarios demonstrate how statistical methods support evidence-based decisions across industries.

## Key Analytical Components
- **Probability Distributions**
  - Binomial distribution modeling for discrete outcomes
  - Normal distribution analysis for continuous variables
- **Statistical Inference**
  - Expected value and variance calculations
  - Sampling distributions and mean behavior
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Histograms and distribution shape assessment
  - Scatterplots and correlation analysis
- **Normality Testing**
  - Shapiro-Wilk test to validate distribution assumptions
- **Interpretation & Insights**
  - Translating statistical results into actionable conclusions

## Tools & Technologies
- R
- R Markdown
- Base R statistical functions
- Data visualization libraries

## Key Insights
- Sports performance outcomes can be effectively modeled using binomial probability distributions when win probabilities are stable.
- Manufacturing life-span data closely follows a normal distribution, enabling reliability and quality forecasting.
- Sampling distributions demonstrate convergence toward the population mean, reinforcing foundational statistical principles.
- Visual and statistical methods together provide stronger evidence than either approach alone.

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied probability modeling in R
- Statistical reasoning under uncertainty
- Data-driven interpretation for non-technical audiences
- Translating theoretical statistics into practical analytics use cases
